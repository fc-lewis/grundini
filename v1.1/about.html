                <p>Peter Grundy and Tilly Northedge met at the Royal College of Art in the late 70s where they became
                    interested in
                    a visual communication that explained rather than sold things. In 1980 they started a studio to do
                    information
                    design in a new and creative way which they called Grundy & Northedge</p>

                <p>Hugh Aldersey-Williams writing in Graphis in 1995 said of them;</p>
                <blockquote>The humble basic communication of information has never had the glamour of other areas of
                    design. The creation
                    of a poster casts the designer as an artist. Bringing into being corporate identity for some giant
                    multinational
                    company showcase the designer as a business strategist. But the design of a map for a housing
                    project or
                    a set
                    of instructions for how to tie a bow tie - what sort of designer does jobs like these?

                    Peter Grundy and Tilly Northedge worked together for twenty-five years.</p>
                <p>

                    In 2006 Peter Grundy started Grundini, taking the Grundy & Northedge experience into new territory.
                    A
                    year later
                    his book Grundini set out the terms, a series of five themes explored with uncompromised
                    individuality
                    thus
                    defining the new era, venturing beyond information and into brand and advertising. Anywhere in fact
                    where the
                    complex and perplex needed explaining by simple, elegant, visual messages and ideas.
